It has come to our attention that local Chinese media have recently made an unverified claim that Keystone Academy is currently opening a campus in Wuhan. This is not true. It is the case that one of Keystone’s primary benefactors, who is deeply passionate about education in China, is currently in the process of creating a school that meets the rising needs of local middle class families in Wuhan. However, this new educational initiative has no links to Keystone Academy in brand name, educational curriculum, faculty, administration, or any other aspect. There is only one Keystone – a school we have grown together, as a community. We would like to restate our commitment not to establish new Keystones in other cities, and we welcome and encourage other innovative and great schools to take root and blossom in China.
