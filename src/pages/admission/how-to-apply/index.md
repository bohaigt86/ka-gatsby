Keystone is a school community dedicated to nurturing academic excellence, creativity, discovery, and compassion within its student body. We are looking for students who are ready to handle a rigorous academic program that embodies high expectations. We also seek to bring together a group of bright, broadly talented students, and we will help them to develop and grow in intellectual, physical, social, and cultural realms.

A qualified student is one who is likely to find success in the Academy's bilingual, residential, university preparatory program. This determination shall be made by Keystone through a variety of means. We are looking for students who bring a unique set of qualities to their class at the Academy, and who distinguish themselves in their potential, their academic performance and the various components of our admission application.
