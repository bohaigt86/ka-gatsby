Dear Prospective Keystone Family,

Thank you very much for your interest in our exciting and groundbreaking new school! As we bring together the best of Eastern and Western approaches to education, Keystone is a school community dedicated to nurturing academic excellence, creativity, discovery, and compassion within its student body. We seek to bring together a group of broadly talented students in order to help them develop and grow in intellectual, physical, social, and cultural realms.

We are looking for students who are bright and bold in their thinking, creative in their approach, determined in their execution, collaborative in their teamwork, humble in their achievement, and hungry for opportunity. While students face a demanding and immensely rewarding, bilingual curriculum at Keystone, they also find caring teachers who are invested in their individual success, and a variety of opportunities to explore their interests in academics, visual arts, music, and athletics.

Keystone is a school that offers new and distinctive opportunities in Beijingâ€”focused on producing graduates who are well prepared for top English-speaking university settings around the world, and who are devoted to being forces for positive change in their communities. We want our students to thrive during their time at Keystone and to graduate with wonderful memories and lifelong friendships. They will also move on from Keystone with a great intellectual foundation for future study, and the confidence necessary to achieve their goals and make contributions to the welfare of others.

We look forward to having you apply to our school and to having you become a part of the exciting Keystone adventure! For further information about Keystone, the application process and upcoming deadlines, please fill out a request for information; we will be in touch.

Kind regards,
Admission Department
