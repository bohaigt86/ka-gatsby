Derek Davies is Keystone’s first Director of Activities. No stranger to the Beijing athletics scene, Mr. Davies served in the Athletics/Activities Director post for many years at the Western Academy of Beijing. He was the founding Chairperson of the Beijing and Tianjin International Schools Athletic Conference (ISAC) and was responsible for creating The Association of China and Mongolia International Schools (ACAMIS) organizing its first ever multi-sports event. Mr. Davies is certified in Primary Education majoring in Physical Education from Wollongong University and is also certified by The Department of Education and Science in the UK. He is an active sport and outdoorsman, and is looking forward to creating new programs and a vibrant community at Keystone. One of his primary goals is to create a new sporting league of schools that best suits Keystone’s philosophy.
