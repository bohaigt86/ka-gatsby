Kacy Song is the Director of Libraries. Reading is not just a hobby or passion for Ms. Song, it is her second nature. She firmly believes that a library is a place where all human wisdom comes to life and it is where you can really “talk” with the wisest people in the world. Ms. Song has seven years experience, first as the middle and high schools Assistant Librarian at BCIS and, most recently, as Primary School Librarian at Yew Chung International School. She is a graduate in International Economics and Trade from the Beijing International Studies University. During Keystone’s pre-opening period, Ms. Song worked as Senior Editor because of her strong writing skills in both Chinese and English. She hopes to create a unique cultural blend for Keystone’s residential program.
